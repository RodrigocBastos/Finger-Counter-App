The Finger Counter App is a Python script that detects how many fingers are held up in front of a webcam in real-time. It utilizes the powerful hand tracking capabilities of MediaPipe and processes video frames using OpenCV.

This application can serve as a foundational project for gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or interactive games that require hand gesture inputs.

ðŸ§  How It Works
The application uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time. By analyzing the positions of these landmarks, the script determines which fingers are raised.

Thumb Detection: The script checks the relative position of the thumb tip to determine if it's extended.
Other Fingers: For each finger, it compares the vertical positions of the fingertip and the joint two points below it.
